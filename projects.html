                    <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                    <p class="project-description">
                        Led a comprehensive project to transform Cigna's compliance reporting and healthcare tool integration. The existing processes were slow, manual, and error-prone, increasing audit risks and operational inefficiencies. Delivered a suite of four critical healthcare tools and interactive Power BI dashboards providing real-time visibility into compliance metrics, audit readiness, and staff training completion.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Business Challenge</h3>
                    <p class="project-description">
                        Manual compliance reporting was creating significant audit risks, while disconnected tools led to inconsistent data and poor visibility. The organization faced 30% higher effort due to rework from misaligned tools and user needs. With increasing regulatory scrutiny (HIPAA audits, CMS requirements) and industry-wide push toward automation and analytics in healthcare compliance, Cigna needed faster, accurate compliance reporting and unified tools for seamless data sharing.
                    </p>

                        Ensured HIPAA and CMS audit guideline compliance through Azure encryption and role-based Power BI access controls. Established PMO-aligned governance frameworks with change control processes managed through JIRA ticketing and Git version control. Implemented quarterly dashboard updates and monthly security patching protocols.

                    <h3>Long-term Impact & Scalability</h3>
                    <p class="project-description">
                        Created a reusable framework designed for multi-region expansion and adaptable to other compliance areas (e.g., GDPR). Standardized compliance reporting processes improved alignment between IT and compliance operations. The solution positioned Cigna for faster audit readiness and reduced risk of non-compliance fines while enabling data-driven decision-making across the organization.
